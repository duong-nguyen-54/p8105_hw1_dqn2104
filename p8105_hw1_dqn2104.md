# Problem 1

``` r
data("early_january_weather")
?early_january_weather
```

    ## starting httpd help server ... done

``` r
mean(early_january_weather$temp)
```

    ## [1] 39.58212

## Description of the data

This dataset shows weather data on hourly meterological data for LGA,
JFK, and EWR for the month of January 2013. This data frame has 358 and
15 represening hourly measurements of 15 variables. Some of its
variables include temperature, humidity, wind direction&speed&gust
speed, precipitation,etc. The average temperature is 39.5821229.

## Scatterplot

``` r
plot = 
  ggplot(early_january_weather, aes(x=time_hour, y=temp, color=humid))+
  geom_point() + 
  labs( x = "Time (Hours)",
        y = "Temperature(F)")

### Description of the graph

The scatterplot shows a non-linear graph between time and temperature.
Due to its being an hourly documentation of temperature, it is usual to
see this pattern as the temperature tends to go down at night, but
rising in the morning. However, overall, we can see an upward trend as
it peaks at about 57 degree while its lowest point being 24 degree.
There maybe a positive correlation between temperature and humidity as
higher temperature leads to higher humidity, but further analysis is
needed to conclude this.

# Problem 2

## Make Dataframe

``` r
df_2 = tibble(
  number=rnorm(10),
  logical=ifelse(number>0, TRUE, FALSE),
  character=sample(letters,10,replace=TRUE),
  factor=factor(rep(c("A","B","C"),length.out=10)))

print(df_2)
```

    ## # A tibble: 10 Ã— 4
    ##     number logical character factor
    ##      <dbl> <lgl>   <chr>     <fct> 
    ##  1 -0.0808 FALSE   l         A     
    ##  2  1.93   TRUE    u         B     
    ##  3 -0.249  FALSE   t         C     
    ##  4  0.665  TRUE    c         A     
    ##  5  1.71   TRUE    x         B     
    ##  6  0.0686 TRUE    h         C     
    ##  7  0.0752 TRUE    p         A     
    ##  8  0.318  TRUE    o         B     
    ##  9  0.160  TRUE    q         C     
    ## 10  0.341  TRUE    p         A

## Calculate mean

``` r
mean_number = mean(pull(df_2,number))
mean_logical = mean(pull(df_2,logical))
mean_character = mean(pull(df_2,character))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_2, character)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

``` r
mean_factor = mean(pull(df_2,factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_2, factor)): argument is not numeric or
    ## logical: returning NA

Out of 4 variables of dataframe above, we can only calculate mean of
numeric and logical ones, while taking mean of characters and factors
yeilds to NA_real\_ result.

## as.numeric code chunk

``` r
df_2 %>%
  logical=as.numeric(logical)
#error shows "cannot coerce type 'closure' to vector of type 'double'"
df_2 %>%
  character=as.numeric(character)
#error shows "cannot coerce type 'closure' to vector of type 'double'"
df_2 %>%
  factor=as.numeric(factor)
#error shows "cannot coerce type 'closure' to vector of type 'double'"
```

We can see that we canâ€™t perform as.numeric for all, but we still can
calculate mean for logical + numeric. Logical variables can be
considered as 1=TRUE, 0=FALSE, hence, resulting in mean.
